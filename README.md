# üïπÔ∏è Flow Game Engine (Full-State Flow Matching)

This repository contains a **toy implementation** of a **Flow Matching model** used as a **game engine** in JAX/Flax. The model operates on *fully observable* states, learning to transition a given state $x_t$ conditioned on an action $a_t$ to the next state $x_{t+1}$. Allowing it's utilization as a game engine. 

### Extension to Partially Observable Processes

This framework can be easily extended to partially observable settings by learning the transition distribution from a history of past states and actions $(x_t, x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, \ldots)$ to the next state  $x_{t+1}$.  
Such a formulation enables modeling in environments where the full current state is not observable, but recent state history provides sufficient information for prediction.

## üß∞ Installation

To set up the environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml

conda activate flow_game_engine

conda install conda-build  # if not already installed
conda develop .
```

## Quick start

```bash

# Generate Dataset
python scripts/get_data.py

# Train model
python scripts/train.py

# Play
python scripts/play.py
```
